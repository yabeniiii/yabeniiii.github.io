      Photography
    </h1>
    <p>
      I've been doing some film photography for a while now, here's some of the pics I'm more proud of. I've decided to
      attach a little explanation of what I like with each shot, more as an exercise of recognising why I like them, I
      think it'll both help me appreciate them more and help me develop my skills. Shot on a Pentax
      Spotmatic.

    <p> Kodak Gold, 55mm Takumar<br>
      Frankly this one probably isn't actually very good, but there's something about it I kinda like.

    <p> Kodak Gold, 55mm Takumar<br>
      Not the most creative framing, but I love the colours in this one, and I think I got a decent balance of subject
      and negative space.

    <p> Kodak Gold, 55mm Takumar<br>
      Something about this little alley just really feels like a nice composition, the way the street leads the eye, the
      car, the subtle framing from the tunnel in the foreground. Really good depth I think.

      Took this one in very heavy rain. I really like how the colours look in this one, something I've especially
      noticed with some others is that Kodak Gold seems to make really nice, warm colours in low light conditions. The
      slight haze from the rain adds to it as well I think, kinda dreamy idk.
    </p>
    <div class="divider"></div>
    <img src="photography/005.JPG"></img>
    <p> Kodak Gold, 55mm Takumar<br> My decision to put something kinda flat in the foreground and focus in on that had
      a nice effect here I think, people more knowledgable than I would probably mention depth or something like that
    </p>
    <div class="divider"></div>
    <img src="photography/006.JPG"></img>
    <p> Kodak Gold, 55mm Takumar<br>More of what I meant about the Kodak Gold in lower light. I like the way the path
      kinda leads the eye down the street and then on to the little spire in the distance. Probably could have done with
      less negative space on the left side of the frame though.</p>
    <div class="divider"></div>
    <img src="photography/007.JPG"></img>
    <p> Kodak Gold, 55mm Takumar<br> Again with the low light. I kinda like the simplicity of the subject here, the out
      of focus lights in the background, the angle it's taken at. There's nothing of any real visual interest in it yet
      i quite like it</p>
    <div class="divider"></div>
    <img src="photography/008.JPG"></img>
    <p> Kodak Gold, 55mm Takumar<br>This is actually the first film photo I ever took. The out of focus foreground and
      the bright colours of the buildings at the end of the alleyway are nice, I think. Once again, probably too much
      negative space</p>
    <div class="divider"></div>
    <img src="photography/009.JPG"></img>
    <p> Kodak Gold, 55mm Takumar<br>Not sure what to say about this one, aside from the lighting is really nice and the
      way the branches frame it too. A pretty basic photo if I'm honest but i do like it</p>
    <div class="divider"></div>
    <img src="photography/010.JPG"></img>
    <p> Kodak Gold, 55mm Takumar<br>This is another depth one I guess, the leaves on either side really framing it, the
      path giving some direction.</p>
